# Lidar_MotionBased_Musical_System

In this project, we produce LIDAR Motion based musical system. The system has three main parts; Master device (Raspberry Pi 3B+), 360 RP Lidar A1 and sound speaker. Master device is responsible for reading LIDAR and controlling the speaker. When a person gets close the LIDAR, the system is trigerred and music is played slowly. The sound volume is depend on distance of the LIDAR data.
